# Enhanced Incident Types Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds support for two distinct types of incident reports:
1. **Vehicle-Specific Incidents** - Require license plate identification
2. **Location-Based Hazards** - Focus on road conditions without requiring vehicle identification

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Database Schema Updates ✅
- Created migration file: `database/migrations/001_enhanced_incident_types.sql`
- Added 14 new incident types to the enum
- Made `license_plate_hash` field optional
- Added `subcategory` field for detailed classification
- Created `incident_type_metadata` table with all incident type information

### Phase 2: Backend API Updates ✅
- Updated TypeScript types in `way-share-backend/src/types/index.ts`
- Created incident type helper utilities in `way-share-backend/src/utils/incidentTypeHelpers.ts`
- Updated validation middleware to handle optional license plates
- Modified report service to support optional license plates and subcategories
- Added new API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/reports/incident-types` - Get all incident types with metadata
  - `GET /api/v1/reports/incident-types/:type` - Get specific incident type details

### Phase 3: Frontend Updates ✅
- Created new components:
  - `IncidentTypeSelector.tsx` - Main incident type selection UI
  - `SubcategorySelector.tsx` - Dropdown for selecting subcategories
  - `IncidentTypeStep.tsx` - New step in the report flow
- Updated report flow to start with incident type selection
- Modified Redux state management to handle new fields
- Updated validation to skip license plate for location-based hazards
- Enhanced review step to display subcategories and handle optional license plates

## New Incident Types Added

### Vehicle-Specific (License Plate Required)
- Parking Violations (with 7 subcategories)
- Unsecured Loads (with 4 subcategories)
- Littering (with 4 subcategories)
- Failure to Signal (with 3 subcategories)
- Impaired Driving (with 4 subcategories)
- Reckless Driving (with 4 subcategories)

### Location-Based Hazards (No License Plate Required)
- Rock Chips
- Potholes
- Road Surface Issues (with 4 subcategories)
- Traffic Signal Problems (with 4 subcategories)
- Dangerous Road Conditions (with 7 subcategories)
- Debris in Road (with 4 subcategories)
- Dead Animals
- Fallen Obstacles (with 4 subcategories)

## User Flow Changes

### Old Flow:
1. Capture License Plate → 2. Details → 3. Review → 4. Submit

### New Flow:
1. **Select Incident Type** → 2. Capture License Plate (if required) → 3. Details → 4. Review → 5. Submit

For location-based hazards, the license plate capture step is skipped entirely.

## Database Migration Instructions

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database
2. Run the migration script:
   ```bash
   psql -d your_database -f database/migrations/001_enhanced_incident_types.sql
   ```
   Or use the helper script:
   ```bash
   psql -d your_database -f database/run_migration.sql
   ```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Database Testing**:
   - Verify all new incident types are available
   - Test creating reports with and without license plates
   - Ensure subcategories are properly stored

2. **API Testing**:
   - Test validation for vehicle-specific incidents (license plate required)
   - Test validation for location-based hazards (license plate optional)
   - Verify incident type metadata endpoints work correctly

3. **Frontend Testing**:
   - Test the new incident type selection flow
   - Verify license plate step is skipped for location-based hazards
   - Test subcategory selection for applicable incident types
   - Ensure review step correctly displays all information

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing reports remain valid
- Existing incident types continue to work as before
- API maintains backward compatibility for current clients

## Future Enhancements

1. Add ability to upload multiple photos for location-based hazards
2. Implement geofencing for automatic incident type suggestions
3. Add real-time notifications for nearby hazards
4. Create dashboard for city officials to view location-based issues
