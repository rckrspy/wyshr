## Upgrade Instructions

### From 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

#### Database Migration
1. **Apply database migration**:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d wayshare -f /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/migrations/001_enhanced_incident_types.sql
   ```

2. **Verify migration**:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d wayshare -c "SELECT count(*) FROM incident_type_metadata;"
   ```

#### Application Update
1. **Rebuild and deploy**:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **Test new features**:
   - Navigate to `/report` and verify incident type selection flow
   - Test location-based hazard reporting without license plate
   - Verify back navigation preserves state

#### Breaking Changes
- **API**: Reports now require incident type selection before license plate (affects custom integrations)
- **Database**: New required metadata table - ensure migration is applied before deployment
